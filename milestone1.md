Project Proposal: 

Both Sides is an app that curates political news from multiple news sources and presents them in categories labelled liberal and conservative. Our app’s target user population are both  moderate US citizens or people who have not formed opinions in politics yet, but are interested in educating themselves. This fits the project theme of designing for people very different from yourselves because all of our team members identify as liberal and mostly read from similar liberal news sources. We are designing for people very different from themselves since we have all already formed opinions on politics and usually read from the same news sources. Some possible sources of real-world data or API’s we plan on using are Twitter’s API.  We will look at the tweets that comes from specific news sources that we will later have to refine to create a strong balance from both sides.

Note: The (^) arrow pops users back all the way to the top no matter how far down they are, since this is an infinite scrollable design.
