# Project Proposal: 

Both Sides is an app that curates political news from multiple news sources and presents them in categories labelled liberal and conservative. Our app’s target user population are both  moderate US citizens or people who have not formed opinions in politics yet, but are interested in educating themselves. This fits the project theme of designing for people very different from yourselves because all of our team members identify as liberal and mostly read from similar liberal news sources. We are designing for people very different from themselves since we have all already formed opinions on politics and usually read from the same news sources. Some possible sources of real-world data or API’s we plan on using are Twitter’s API.  We will look at the tweets that comes from specific news sources that we will later have to refine to create a strong balance from both sides.

# Storyboard 1:

This storyboard represents a user who already knows that he is moderate politically, but he has no easy way to get both party's opinion on breaking news.


















# Storyboard 2:

This storyboard represents a user who is uninformed about politics and needs an easy way to see which political party they side more with.

This paper prototype uses an infinite scrolling approach, with tiles for each news story and colored indicators for which article belongs to which party.









Note: The (^) arrow pops users back all the way to the top no matter how far down they are, since this is an infinite scrollable design.



# Paper Prototype 2:

This paper prototype uses a 5 story per day swiping approach. Giving the user a "newspaper" like interactivity but with limited freedom in the amount of articles they can view.
