# Project Proposal (Same as Milestone1): 

Both Sides is an app that curates political news from multiple news sources and presents them in categories labelled liberal and conservative. Our app’s target user population are both  moderate US citizens or people who have not formed opinions in politics yet, but are interested in educating themselves. This fits the project theme of designing for people very different from yourselves because all of our team members identify as liberal and mostly read from similar liberal news sources. We are designing for people very different from themselves since we have all already formed opinions on politics and usually read from the same news sources. Some possible sources of real-world data or API’s we plan on using are Twitter’s API.  We will look at the tweets that comes from specific news sources that we will later have to refine to create a strong balance from both sides.

# Similarity / Difference from Milestone1
We had no changes in our Project Proposal and we decided to move forward with our idea from Milestone1 (as seen above). However, we did have some UI changes as we went along the way. 

# Screenshots of UI Skeleton

For the UI Skeleton, we unanimously decided to move forwards with Prototype #1 due to it's simplicity and cleanliness compared to Prototype #2. However, our Skeleton drew upon ideas from both Prototype #1 and #2, though it heavily emphasizes the design of Prototype #1.

As one can see, both prototype #1 Home Page and skeleton home page have the same basic layout of having the banner on top with the Project Name with containers below containing the article title and "Left", "Mid"(In the skeleton, we wrote "Center" because Centrism is the correct term for those who are in the middle grounds in politics), and "Right", all in their respective colored indicator*. However, the differences are that we shifted " ^ " from the top left to bottom center of the screen for aesthetics as it would make the page more symmetric, thus keeping the page tidy. Also, we included a summary description underneath the Headline, so users can have a brief summary of the topic before diving in. This can also help users decide whether or not they are interested in the topic or not. One significant change made was that we added a "Saved" bookmark page, which can be accessed through the star marked "Saved" on the top right corner. This bookmark functionality originates from Prototype #2. This is for the ease of the user if the user wanted to bookmark a article he/she would like to read later or if he/she just wanted to save the article. In order to add these articles, on the Home Page we also included a star next to each article for the user to select if they wanted to save that article. This star is a new addition that does not appear in either Prototype #1 or #2. It is a simple way for the user to bookmark the article of interest with one click!

* Blue = Left, Center = grey, Right = Red

In our saved html, we drew our inspiration heavily from Prototype #2's Saved Screen. However, we did not include the top left settings button because instead, we have a back button which would lead us back to the previous page. However, the settings menu is a goal we are intending on implementing in future milestones. The Prototype has the back button on the top right but we shifted it to the left because users are used to the back button being the left most (See any web browser) and thus it would be an ease of usage for the user if we moved the back button to the upper left. Another asthetic change made was that we minimized the trash icon and placed it on the top right of the article container, rather than having a huge trash icon next to the article container. This was for the sake of cleanliness and a large trash icon is not necessary as it will distract the user's attention. In addition, we included a "Back to top" button because we plan on implementing a infinite scrolling page where we can keep scrolling down as long as there was saved articles and so we wanted to create a button to help users navigate to the top again.

![Image of Right Leaning](https://github.com/CamdynR/Cogs121/blob/master/static_files/Right.html)




Since Left, Middle, Right Leaning pages' core functionality and main designs are identical, except for the banner color(signifying the side) and banner title(Left, Middle, or Right), we've decided to group the explanation for these three together.

A major difference between the Prototype and the Left, Middle, Right leaning pages is that we decided to change the banner color and banner title to match the affiliation, instead of keeping it as our Project name. By doing so, we are helping clarify which side is the article on rather than clustering it underneath the article title, which would be harder to find. Similar to the skeleton Home Page, we shifted the back to top button " ^ " from the top left to bottom center of the screen for aesthetics as it would make the page more symmetric, thus keeping the page tidy. In addition, we added a nice large back button on the banner for user ease of usage, if they wanted to navigate back to the previous page. Finally, the last change we made was including an "About the Author" button. This button will provide the background information of the author for the user if the user wanted more information concerning the author, such as he/she's stance, because the authors stance usually dictates how the author will spin the news. The similarities are the layout of the Headline, then link to article, and lastly, the text of the article itself.
