# Screenshots of latest UI: 


# Explanation: 

In our improved UI skeletons, we focused on designing our screens to have a classic Newspaper look. Our color scheme follows a night mode newsaper look. Additionally, within the tiles, we created distinct rounded symbols for the left, center, and right to create more contrast among the different viewpoints. We also added a search functionality to allow users to search for keywords for desired articles. Clicking on the magnifying glass symbol makes the searchbox appear. The header is fixed so as the user scrolls down to read different articles, the search functionality still appears for increased accessbility and convenience.
