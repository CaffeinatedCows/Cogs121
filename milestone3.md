# Screenshots of latest UI: 


# Explanation: 

In our improved UI skeletons, we focused on designing our screens to have a classic Newspaper look. Our color scheme follows a night mode newsaper look. Additionally, within the tiles, we added symbols for left, center, and right to create more contrast among the different viewpoints. We also added a search functionality to allow users to search for keywords for desired articles. The header with the search moves as the user scrolls down to read different articles for increased accessbility and convenience.
