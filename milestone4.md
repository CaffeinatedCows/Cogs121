# UI Improvements: 

Our latest UI includes frames for each side of the news story. Users are taken to a separate page once they click on the point of view they want to read and are given a brief preview of the aricle. There is also a link to the external news source. A search page has also been added so that users can search and see results on a separate page for a cleaner look. Additionally, the favorites/saved option was omitted so users can simply use the application wtihout creating accounts for a low commitment experience.  


# User Action 1 Explanation: 

The first user action is the search option. Users can search for articles based on keywords in the titles or content. The results are then displayed on the same page. Multiple searches can be made on the same page. This is a key part of the applicaton's functionality as it allows users to find specific topics from a variety of articles. 

# User Action 2 Explanation: 

The second user action is previewing an article's content before reading the full article externally. Users can choose which point of view to click on for different headlines and get a glimpse of what the article is about before committing to reading the full article from the news source itself. This is a key part of the application's functionality as it creates a way to quickly glance at topics and content before taking the time to fully read the information.
