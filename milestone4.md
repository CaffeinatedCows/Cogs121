# UI Improvements: 

Our latest UI includes frames for each side of the news story. They are taken to a separate page once they click on the point of view they want to read and are given a brief preview of the aricle as well as a link to the external news source. Additionally, the favorites/saved option was omitted so users can simply use the application wtihout creating accounts. 


# User Action 1 Explanation: 

The first user action is the search option. Users can search for articles based on keywords in the titles or content. This is a key part of the applicaton's functionality as it allows users to find specific topics from a variety of articles. 

# User Action 2 Explanation: 

The second user action is previewing an article's content before reading the full article externally. Users can choose which point of view to click on for different headlines and get a glimpse of what the article is about before committing to reading the full article from the news source itself. This is a key part of the application's functionality as it creates a way to quickly glance at topics and content before taking the time to fully read the information.
